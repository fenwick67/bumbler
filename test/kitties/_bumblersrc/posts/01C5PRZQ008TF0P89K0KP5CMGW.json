It has to cut corners in order to squeeze out profit. It has to pay people less, so it gets workers who are less capable and has them spend less time on each job (convict). </p><p> The specific reason is that human contact helps guide people away from crime.  The way these companies increase &quot;efficiency&quot; means less human contact.   </p>",
