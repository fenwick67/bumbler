  "caption": "A straightforward, DIY CMS for photos, images, statuses, audio, blog posts or whatever.  It's optimized for microblogging, but can be used for macroblogging as well.\n\n## Features\n\n* Your site your rules.  No censorship, plus simple yet powerful theming\n* Host your files in their original size and format\n* Two ways to publish:\n  1. Self-host and instantly publish from anywhere, anytime\n  2. Builds out to static files, so you can easily write locally and push to github-pages, Neocities, or any other system\n\n## Installation\n\nstep 0: install Node.js v7+ and NPM, and open a terminal.\n\n1. `npm install -g bumbler`\n2. Create a new folder for your site\n3. `cd` into your new site folder\n4. Run `bumbler init` inside it and follow the directions\n  - **DO NOT** re-use a password for the admin interface.  Seriously.  This software is pre-alpha and there are probably security holes.\n\n# Publishing\n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nIf you have an extra $7/month, you can host it on DigitalOcean ($5), with backups ($1), and get a domain ($1).  Here are some tips:\n\n* Bumbler will **not** work on Heroku or other SAAS platforms with an ephemeral filesystem, because of Bumbler's filesystem-based nature.  All of your files and settings will get blown away every 24 hours or so.\n* Install nodejs v7 using the instructions here:  https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#deb\n* When running `npm install`, use the `--production` flag to reduce the dependencies and install time\n* Use HTTPS.  You can sign up for CloudFlare's free plan, which includes free auto-renewing certificates.\n* You can use [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to easily manage app startup and shutdown\n  - use `pm2 startup` to install startup scripts\n  - use only one process (because of in-memory session storage)\n  - use `pm2 save` to save your running process\n* Set up backups in case your site explodes, or hackers get in and ruin everything.\n\n## Static Hosting\n\nBumblr was *made to work **with or without** a serverside application*.  You can simply move your project files over to a HTTP server and everything will just work.  Almost everything except the admin interface is built out to static files.  \n\nThe only caveat here is that right now it needs to be the root of the domain.  So you will need to set it up at yoursite.com/ or subdomain.othersite.com/\n\n## TODO Items:\n\n### High Priority\n\nSocial features:\n\n* [ ] Create JSON scheme for replying and sharing (reply contexts)\n* [ ] Share a url and parse out H-entry and/or opengraph info in the post interface\n* [ ] bookmarklet / plugin to share from browser.  Create an API route to redirect for sharing.\n* [ ] hit a peer's Webmention URL when sharing\n\n### Medium Priority\n\nAfter implementing social features:\n\n* [ ] Put a RSS feed reader into the admin interface\n  - [ ] I can reuse some work from mastofeed for this\n\n### Low Priority\n\nplugin system\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![screenshot](https://github.com/fenwick67/bumbler-themes/raw/master/masonry.png)\n![admin screenshot](https://github.com/fenwick67/bumbler/raw/master/doc/admin-screenshot.png)\n",
