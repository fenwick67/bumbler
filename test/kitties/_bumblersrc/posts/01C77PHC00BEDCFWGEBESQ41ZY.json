Thousands of students left school to protest. </p><p> The school superintendent of Needville, Texas, declared he would <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2018/2/21/1743418/-Texas-school-district-threatens-suspension-if-students-protest-to-prevent-the-next-mass-shooting\">suspend any students</a> that walk out of school to protest. </p><p> I hope all the high school students in that district walk out to protest at his office, to show they are not going to be intimidated. </p><p> If he follows through with the threat to &quot;suspend&quot; them, they can organize a three-day teach-in, where they will learn things that are more important than what is normally taught in school.   </p>",
