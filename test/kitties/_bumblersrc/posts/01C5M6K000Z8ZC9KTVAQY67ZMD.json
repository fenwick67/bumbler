Here are many reasons why. <ul> <li> Half of the people in any country are below average in intelligence. Many of them can't learn a complex job and do it well. </li> <li> Many of the people that lose their jobs are no longer young. They can't learn and remember a lot of new details the way they could have done 20 years before. </li> <li> Training programs, under today's political situation, will cost substantial money.  If you are broke, like more than half of all Americans, and then lose your job, you'd need a student loan. <p> Student loans today are dangerous.  If you don't get the degree (maybe you're not among the brightest students), or of you don't get the job afterward (maybe previous graduates filled the demand), you're left with the student loans on your back for the rest of your life. </p></li> <li> The school might cheat you, as other private training academies have done. Obama worked to forgive the student debts, but the <a href=\"/glossary.html#bully\">bully</a>'s saboteur DeVos has <a href=\"https://stallman.org/archives/2017-may-aug.html#26_May_2017_(The_troll_and_DeVos)\">cancelled that</a>. </li> <li> Nowadays, even many of the jobs that require training and a license offer lousy pay. </li> <li> You might have to move to a city where that lousy pay isn't enough for you to find a place to live. </li> </ul> We need to resist changes that take away large number of jobs. We need a welfare system that will give every American a decent life even if person can't do job that offers decent pay.   </p>",
