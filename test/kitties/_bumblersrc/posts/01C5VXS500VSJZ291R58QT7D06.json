For instance, Facebook will still be able to sell targeted advertising aimed at its useds.  That doesn't violate these new rules. </p><p> Also, this directive does nothing to protect people from Big Brother. The directive has no effect on how states in the EU forcibly take the data once companies have collected.  The only benefit for dissidents will be if the directive convinces some companies to hold less data about people.   </p>",
