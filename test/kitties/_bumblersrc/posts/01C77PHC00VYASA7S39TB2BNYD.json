People make this promise because of social pressure that many do not see a way to resist.  Under such circumstances, I refuse to criticize them for breaking it. </p><p> This is why I refuse to criticize the <a href=\"/glossary.html#bully\">bully</a> for having affairs with attractive celebrities. </p><p> <a href=\"/glossary.html#bully\">The bully</a> is doing tremendous harm to the US and the world.  Let's not get distracted from this by peccadilloes.   </p>",
