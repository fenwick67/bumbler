First, the &quot;idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people&quot; does not necessarily mean a communist dictatorship.  It could refer to social democracy, such as the New Deal in the US. </p><p> Second, the brief US attack on Serbia was intended to stop violent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.  I won't argue that this was the only or the best way to do it, but it wasn't bare-faced aggression and it did stop the attacks against Albanian Kosovars. </p><p> Reducing US world interventions won't necessarily mean peace.  Chinese hegemony is not likely to care much about human rights either.   </p>",
