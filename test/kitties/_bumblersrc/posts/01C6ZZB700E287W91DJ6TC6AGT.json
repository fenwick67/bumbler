  "caption": "Stallman Sez: \n\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/19/krona-public-toilets-cashless-sweden-coin\">Look at the propaganda</a> designed to dishearten people about the privacy of cash. </p><p> It takes a gently derisive tone towards some minor practical inconveniences of tracked digital payments, while suggesting they will soon be solved. The result is to disparage the idea that there is something serious at stake. </p><p> If you live in Sweden — or any other country — plan in advance to carry cash, and only pay cash in stores.  If a store won't take cash, say &quot;I'm going to another store that will.&quot; </p><p> You can easily think of bogus objections, if you are willing to exaggerate — so ignore them instead. </p><p> If you find yourself without cash one day, don't give up — just do better the next day. </p><p> And don't use a pay toilet no matter how they want you to pay.  It is vicious and cruel to make people pay to use a toilet.  I have money, and I could afford to pay, but <em>some people can't</em>.  I have boycotted pay toilets for 10 years.   </p>",
