A study years ago said yes; an attempt to replicate it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/01/famed-impulse-control-marshmallow-test-fails-in-new-research\">found little effect</a>. </p><p> These studies measure correlation between the four-year-olds' untrained capacity to defer gratification and their later abilities. Whether <em>actively teaching</em> four-year-olds to defer gratification would lead to later benefits for them is a different question. </p><p> Indeed, it is possible that changes in patterns of raising children have altered the tendencies that the studies measure.   </p>",
