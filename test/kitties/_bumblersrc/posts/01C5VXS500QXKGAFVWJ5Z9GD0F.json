Poor people are morally entitled to steal food to eat, if they can't afford to buy it, and the suffering imposed by the plutocratic state often puts them in that situation. </p><p> But I hope this convinces the stores to get rid of those machines and hire more human beings. </p><p> You can join me in helping to make that happen.  When I enter the store I pass by those machines and tell the people using them, &quot;If you use those machines, you are putting other Americans out of work.  When I realized that I decided to go always to the human sales clerks so that they can stay employed.&quot;  I do the same thing when I leave. </p><p> You can do it too.   </p>",
