Secondarily, it inspires hatred which can express itself as terrorism.  Justice and human rights demand that the US give each prisoner in Guantanamo a fair trial or release him.  Those who are convicted should be treated according to the US constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. </p><p> Those responsible for torture and enforced disappearance must be brought to justice in fair trial. </p><p> In the name of our country's honor, and the Constitution you have sworn to defend, </p></blockquote>   </p>",
