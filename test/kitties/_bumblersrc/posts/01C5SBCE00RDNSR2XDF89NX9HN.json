(I cite that movie as an example of why we should not advocate censorship of art merely because we find it disgusting.) </p><p> But I never expected his treatment of the cast to resemble the stories he portrays in the films.  I would have considered that sort of inference naive.  And yet in this case it would have been valid. Hmm.   </p>",
