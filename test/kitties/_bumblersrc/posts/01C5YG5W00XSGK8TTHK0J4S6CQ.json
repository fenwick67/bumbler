This solves the immediate problem, but it is not a fair solution. </p><p> Local governments can only tax the local inhabitants and local businesses.  However, wealthy people and big, profitable businesses are not evenly distributed.  In an area where most people are poor, this puts a heavy burden on them.  That's why the national government needs to do the taxing, and distribute the money to all the local governments.   </p>",
