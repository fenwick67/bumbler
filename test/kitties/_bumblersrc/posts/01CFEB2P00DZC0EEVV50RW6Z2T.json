I've read that around 1800 German seemed to be the most common language in the US of the time, though I can't be sure that is accurate. </p><p> The US expanded westward in the 19th century to lands that surely didn't use English much before that.  After the US conquered parts of Mexico in the 1840s, the inhabitants continued speaking Spanish for quite some time.   </p>",
