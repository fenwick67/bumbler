Experiments show that this can <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-will-google-defend-democracy-96838\">influence how people vote</a>. </p><p> It would be very difficult to make regulations against this that a search engine company could not evade.  The computation of search ranking is complex, for good reasons including stopping sites from gaming the system; this creates many places to hide the manipulation and many ways to disguise it. </p><p> I am not sure what the solution could be. </p><p> When I want to check some facts, the first place I look is Wikipedia.  To do a search for articles, then read them, takes a long time, so I rarely go that way. </p><p> It is a shame that the writer endorses the prejudices embodied by <a href=\"https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Consume\">using the word &quot;consume&quot;</a> to refer to reading articles.   </p>",
