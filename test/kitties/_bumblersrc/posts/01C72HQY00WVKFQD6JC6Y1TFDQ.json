Terrorism is a matter of intent: political influence through threats of violence.  Does the NRA do that?  Not directly.  It doesn't threaten to shoot anyone. </p><p> However, in an indirect way, maybe it brings this about. </p><p> The NRA functions <a href=\"https://stallman.org/archives/2016-may-aug.html#17_May_2016_(NRA_misleads_and_misrepresents)\">as a marketing arm</a> for gun companies. Its program is to make Americans scared of gun crime, so that they will buy guns.  Thus, it appears that a higher rate of gun crime is not merely a byproduct of the NRA's activity, but part of its plan. </p><p> Does that fit the definition of terrorism?  I'd say it is on the borderline.  In the end, I think it is better not to stretch the word this far.  We can condemn an organization for wrongdoing without calling that wrongdoing &quot;terrorism&quot;.   </p>",
