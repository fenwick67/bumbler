This is one of the words that people use to show their membership in a <a href=\"https://stallman.org/archives/2017-nov-feb.html#30_January_2018_(Plutocratic_domination)\">political tribe</a>, and I don't want to do that.  I agree politically with some people on various issues, and I am often glad to support their efforts to achieve it, but I won't treat it like membership in a tribe.   </p>",
